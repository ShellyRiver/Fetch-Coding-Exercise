# Fetch-Coding-Exercise

## installation

```
pip install pandas
```

## run the code
If the cost is 5000, run the code using

```
python3 main.py 5000
```

The code checks the validness of the input cost: the cost is a number, > 0, and not causing the remaining points < 0.

## assumptions 
The code assumes the transaction file is valid: all the entries are valid and the costs in the file would not cause the remaining points < 0.
